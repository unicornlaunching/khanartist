                <div class="quote">

                <p>Key points for art students:</p>

                <div class="quote">
                    "It's not necessarily always a pattern. I see Anna because of her personality and her choice of love and passion towards plans, and that's what comes out in here."
                </div>
                <p>Key points for art students:</p>

                    <li><span class="technique-example">Abstract Expression:</span> Fahmi emphasized how abstract art can convey personality and passion, similar to the works of Wassily Kandinsky.</li>
                    <li><span class="technique-example">Pattern and Repetition:</span> The use of patterns was discussed, reminiscent of Yayoi Kusama's iconic polka dot works.</li>
